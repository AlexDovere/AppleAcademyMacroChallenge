# AppleAcademyMacroChallenge
This is my last project from Apple Academy

We started the engage phase analyzing the current covid-19 situation and we decided to act to help the players of this sector. These is our starting point and our way to support customers and restaurants owners. 
In the future perspective our apps will be implemented in the best way   to offer an increasingly more aligned service to market trends and changes.

Easy sit/ Easy sit manager

We decided to develop two apps, one for the clients(made with SwiftUI) and one for the restaurant owners.

The one for clients allows to select a restaurant from the database of affiliated premises and to choose the date and the time slot in which to book. Moreover gives the opportunity to receive directions on how to reach the chosen restaurant.
